# State Monad Refactor Analysis

## Overview

Yes, the Haskell port can be significantly improved using the State monad! I've created a complete State monad-based refactor that demonstrates the benefits. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

## Problems with the Original Approach

### 1. **Manual State Threading**
```haskell
-- Original: Manual state passing everywhere
addNewFacts :: [Fact] -> ProofEnvironment -> ProofEnvironment
addNewFacts [] env = env
addNewFacts (fact:rest) env = do
  -- lots of manual env manipulation
  let (label, envWithLabel) = newLabel "F" env
      factWithLabel = fact { factLabel = Just label }
      updatedEnv = envWithLabel { peFacts = ... }
  addNewFacts rest updatedEnv  -- manual threading
```

### 2. **Error-Prone State Updates**
- Easy to forget to thread state properly
- Risk of using old environment versions
- Complex nested updates

### 3. **Verbose Code**
- Lots of boilerplate for state management
- Hard to follow the actual logic through state manipulation

### 4. **Composition Difficulties**
- Hard to combine operations cleanly
- Complex conditional logic with state updates

## State Monad Solution

### 1. **Clean Monadic Interface**
```haskell
-- New: Clean monadic operations
addNewFacts :: [Fact] -> ProofM ()
addNewFacts [] = return ()
addNewFacts (fact:rest) = do
  facts <- getFacts  -- clean state access
  let duplicateExists = any (...) facts
  
  unless duplicateExists $ do
    label <- newLabel "F"  -- no manual threading!
    let factWithLabel = fact { factLabel = Just label }
    
    modify $ \env -> env   -- atomic state update
      { peFacts = peFacts env ++ [factWithLabel]
      , peFactLabels = Map.insert label factWithLabel (peFactLabels env)
      }
    
    goal <- getGoal
    when (factName fact == factName goal && factArgs fact == factArgs goal) $ do
      modify $ \env -> env { peGoalDisCombos = factDisAncestors fact : peGoalDisCombos env }
      updateGoalAchieved fact
      updateUseful label
  
  addNewFacts rest  -- automatic state threading!
```

### 2. **The ProofM Monad**
```haskell
-- Combines State + IO for our needs
newtype ProofM a = ProofM { unProofM :: StateT ProofEnvironment IO a }
    deriving newtype (Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadState ProofEnvironment, MonadIO)

-- Clean execution interface
runProofM :: ProofM a -> ProofEnvironment -> IO (a, ProofEnvironment)
evalProofM :: ProofM a -> ProofEnvironment -> IO a
execProofM :: ProofM a -> ProofEnvironment -> IO ProofEnvironment
```

### 3. **Composable Operations**
```haskell
-- State accessors
getFacts :: ProofM [Fact]
getTheorems :: ProofM [Theorem] 
getDisjunctions :: ProofM [Disjunction]
isGoalAchieved :: ProofM Bool

-- State modifiers  
addFact :: Fact -> ProofM ()
addDisjunction :: Disjunction -> ProofM ()
setGoalAchieved :: Bool -> ProofM ()

-- Complex operations compose naturally
addConclusions :: [Conclusion] -> ProofM ()
addConclusions concs = do
  let facts = [f | CF f <- concs]
      disjs = [d | CD d <- concs]
  addNewFacts facts      -- automatic composition
  addNewDisjunctions disjs
  pruneDisjunctions
```

### 4. **Cleaner Algorithm Logic**
```haskell
enhancedAutoSolve :: [HyperTheorem] -> Int -> ProofM Bool
enhancedAutoSolve hyperTheorems maxIterations = go 0
  where
    go iteration = do
      goalAchieved <- isGoalAchieved  -- clean state access
      if goalAchieved
        then do
          liftIO $ putStrLn "Success: goal achieved."
          return True
        else if iteration >= maxIterations
        then do
          liftIO $ putStrLn "Max iterations reached."
          return False
        else do
          -- Try regular theorems
          appliedRegular <- applyAvailableTheorems
          
          -- Try hyper-theorems  
          appliedHyper <- applyHyperTheorems hyperTheorems
          
          -- Check goal again
          goalNow <- isGoalAchieved
          if goalNow
            then return True
            else if not (appliedRegular || appliedHyper)
            then return False
            else go (iteration + 1)  -- tail recursion with automatic state threading
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Type Safety**
- State operations are typed and safe
- Can't accidentally mix up different environments
- Compiler catches state threading errors

### 2. **Composability**
```haskell
-- Operations compose naturally
proveGroupNotSimple :: Int -> ProofM Bool
proveGroupNotSimple n = do
  setupInitialFacts n
  applySylowTheorems
  applyNormalizerReasoning  
  isGoalAchieved
```

### 3. **Readability**
- Focus on the algorithm logic, not state management
- Clean separation of concerns
- Self-documenting state operations

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Easier to add new state components
- Less error-prone modifications
- Better abstraction boundaries

### 5. **Performance**
- State monad is efficient (strict StateT)
- No unnecessary copying of large environments
- Atomic state updates

## Practical Comparison

### Original (Manual Threading):
```haskell
applyTheorem :: Theorem -> [Fact] -> ProofEnvironment -> Maybe (ProofEnvironment, [Fact])
applyTheorem theorem facts env =
  -- branch compatibility check
  let disAncLists = map factDisAncestors facts
      -- ... complex manual state logic
  in if not compatible then Nothing else
     if length facts == length (theoremInputFacts theorem)
     then
       let newDisAncestors = Set.unions (map factDisAncestors facts)
           -- ... more manual construction
       in Just (env, newFacts)  -- return tuple
     else Nothing
```

### State Monad Version:
```haskell
applyTheorem :: Theorem -> [Fact] -> ProofM (Maybe [Fact])
applyTheorem theorem facts = do
  -- Same branch compatibility logic (cleaner)
  let disAncLists = map factDisAncestors facts
      pairs = concatMap Set.toList disAncLists :: [DisjunctionAncestor]
      labelToIdxs = M.fromListWith Set.union [(lbl, Set.singleton idx) | (lbl, idx) <- pairs]
      compatible = all (\s -> Set.size s <= 1) (M.elems labelToIdxs)
  
  if not compatible || length facts /= length (theoremInputFacts theorem)
    then return Nothing  -- no manual state management needed
    else do
      let newDisAncestors = Set.unions (map factDisAncestors facts)
          -- ... construct new facts
      return (Just newFacts)  -- state is automatically preserved
```

## Testing Results

Both versions produce identical results:

**Order 12**: ✅ Both find contradiction (G is not simple)
**Order 60**: ✅ Both work correctly  
**Order 108**: ✅ Both explore same search space (inconclusive but consistent)

The State monad version has the same mathematical correctness but significantly cleaner code.

## Recommendation

**Absolutely use the State monad refactor.** The benefits are substantial:

1. **Code Quality**: Much cleaner, more maintainable code
2. **Type Safety**: Compiler-enforced correctness for state operations  
3. **Composability**: Operations combine naturally without manual threading
4. **Readability**: Algorithm logic is clear and separate from state management
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with new state components or operations

The State monad is exactly what it's designed for: managing complex, evolving state through a computation. The proof environment with its facts, disjunctions, labels, and goal tracking is a perfect use case.

## Implementation Files

- **StateEnvironment.hs**: State monad-based environment with ProofM monad
- **StateMain.hs**: Clean main program using monadic composition  
- **Builds as**: `sylow-solver-state` executable

The refactor demonstrates how the State monad transforms imperative-style state management into clean, composable, functional operations while maintaining the same algorithmic behavior.
